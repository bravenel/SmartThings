    This app sets the dimmer levels for a group of lights based on modes.  The dimmer levels are selected for each mode.
    It supports motion sensors that turn on the group, and turns them off after a specified period,
    and has provision for linking to button controllers and Routines, through a button device.
    The location can have other modes, but this app only adjusts the lights for the selected modes.

    The app has a master dimmer and some slave dimmers. The idea is that sometimes the master dimmer physical 
    switch is used to turn on the lights -- the slaves follow, or likewise to turn off some lights.  
    The app also allows you to specify additional switches that are turned off when the master dimmer is turned off.  
    
    It should be noted that for this master switch function to work with near instant response, 
    one must use an instant reporting z-wave dimmer.  One such dimmer is the Leviton VRMX1 
    (which must be included directly to the hub to have instant reporting).
    
    If motion sensors(s) are specified, they turn on the master and all slaves to the 
    current mode dimmer level.  The motion activation can be conditioned on times of day,
    days of week, or modes.  Optionally, the master and slaves can be turned off some minutes
    moton stops.  A switch (possibly virtual) can be turned on to disable motion activation.
    
    The app adjusts dimmer levels on each mode change to the level selcted for that mode.
    A mode change to some other mode has no effect on the dimmer levels. 
    
    The app allows manual changing of the dimmer level, either by the physical switch or mobile app.  
    For example, in the evening, a woman wants to put on makeup and the light isn't bright enough.  
    She turns up the dimmer.  That event is responded to by temporarily adjusting the 
    dimmer level for both master and slaves to that new level.
